Introduction

Believe. is intended to be both a website to help the end-user monitor their 

Nutritional intake and also help them to record their goals with additional help to 

useful motivational/informative pages.   

## Pseudo Code
The website principally has 3 pages: 

* the Index page is intended to first greet the user and be attractive enough to encourage them to proceed further.

* In the top corner there is a command button which opens a Modal button to welcome the user for the first time.  

* The Modal also displays an inspirational message (generated from a web API) which, on refresh, will provide a new message.

* The top 2 images on the page are to encourage the user to view the other pages.

* By the final image, there are links to external sites (related to Mental Health, NHS and Meditation).

* There is a nav bar which contains links to the rest of the site.  (These links are the same pages as the images, however 

  the nav bar is consistent throughout the site.)

* There is a footer which displays the copyright.  This is consistent throughout the site.

*  My Wellbeing Goals links via an href to My-Wellbeing.Html - This page is to record the user's goals.

*  Nutrition Tracking links via an href to Nutrition-Tracking.Html - This page allows the user to calculate their daily

   nutritional intake (Calories, Protein, Fat & Carbohydrate) by selecting items and allocating them to  meals.  Pushing a button 
   
   at the bottom of the page, sums the individual totals and displays them in a card.

My Wellbeing Goals

    This form is presently designed for the user to enter a goal they wish to achieve as a personal accomplishment.

Nutrition Tracking

    This is identifying nutrition in your meals and a day total of nutrition.
